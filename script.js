// Don't worry about consoling these functions, they are already being called on the button clicks.
// Please don't change anything in the index.html file.

function PrintDeveloper() {
  //Write your code here , just console.log
}

  //Write your code here, just console.log
}

function removeAdmin() {
  //Write your code here, just console.log
}

  //Write your code here, just console.log
}

// Here is an example of how functions work,
// basically a function is a block of code which can directly access your 'arr' variable since arr is global.
// If I have a function called consoleArr(), that can directly access arr like this to console it.

function consoleArr() {
  console.log('Consoling Array Variable', arr);
  // Over here I can directly access the variable.
}
